RF Code 201 - Day 6 Journal

Day 6 - Monday 11/14 2016

Heres what we did
0. I noticed that atom . open all the files in a folder... that is useful
1. Code review
- We reviewed problems 1-4 out of the 5 HW problems. 3 was enlightening because nesting led to a far more elegant solution than I came up with.
2. Objects
- we reviewed that there were 4 ways to create objects and went into a couple of ones in detail
- we went into the 'this' word a bit... this was not crystal clear.
3. DOM manipulation
- There are lots of commands you can use the access the DOM in js but document.GetElementbyID() in comination with a div ID is probably going to be the most common way to do it.
4. We reviewed the lab that we will be doing this week - salmon cookies


What I found most useful
- The review was very useful for me as I pulled some of the problems off but only barely.
- Its always good to do the 3 hours of lectures in the morning.

Questions/Comments
1. I feel as though some fully written out examples that are mini versions of the days project would be useful as a stepping stone. The sample code provided from the days class is useful but more non book handout or pdf overviews would be useful to summarize the days material.
