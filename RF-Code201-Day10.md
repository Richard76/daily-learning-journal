Code 201 - Day 10 Journal

Day 10 - Friday 11/18 2016

Heres what we did
1. Talked about how to do the hourly subtotal in the Salmon Project. I was doing 2 loops already. I get the idea of how to solve it. But things still don't work after fiddling with it multiple times.
2. Week review
- Best thing to do is review these daily notes for the previous four days.
- We do cover a lot of ground every day.
3. Big boss man came in to talk to us before lunch. People asked lots of questions about jobs.
4. Watched the first 2 of 5 Code 401 mid term projects at lunchtime.
5. Worked on a new time constricted wireframe project as a pair programming project from 1:30pm to 5pm.
- We did pretty well as it looks almost like what it should.
- Clear Fix still makes no sense to me.

What I found most useful
- The discussuon before lunch about front end developer, full stack developer, and software engineer. 
- As I am here to apply web, I see a solid desire to learn front end, a small/medium desire to learn full stack.. thats if I wanted a career change, and a tiny desire to be a software engineer.

Questions/Comments
- None I can think of right now.
