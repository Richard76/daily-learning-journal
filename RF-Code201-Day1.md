# RF Code 201 - Day 1 Journal

Heres what we did
- Overview stuff like grading & what it will take to get into code 301
- command line - how to create files & move around
- github - how to pull stuff down from github, change it, and push the changes back up using the command line.
- our first attempt creating a super simple js program in atom & posting it to a github gist
- this markup - its to be done every day as a summary of the days work.

What I found most useful
- creating a repository on github, pulling it down to the right place, making changes, and pushing it back up myself.
- that was pretty useful. I think I'm getting github witch is one of the things i was most concerned about.
