# RF Code 201 - Day 2 Journal

Day 3 - Wed 11/9 2016

Heres what we did
1. Code review
2. Types review
3. Arrays review
4. Assignment Overview
5. The Assignment => Add to guessing games to the last assignment


What I found most useful
- command + option + j ==> pulls up the console in the browser
- null vs undefined => its undefined by default. someone would have to set it to null.
- Muddling through the assignment... for hours... I started it at 6pm left after 6pm. I think.
-- nesting statements is hard. I've seen editors that have the ability to stepthough in order to help see where stuff is going wrong. that would really help.

- How do I do stepthrough in the console to help figure out where things are going wrong?
