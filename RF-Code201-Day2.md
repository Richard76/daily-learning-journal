# RF Code 201 - Day 2 Journal

Day 1 - Tue 11/8 2016

Heres what we did
- Git Branching
- Connecting an html, css, & js files together


What I found most useful
- git branching because I already know how to do the other thing.

a branch is good for adding a feature (without worrying about breaking what you have) and then rolling those updates back in to the master at a later date.

You could have x people working on different things at the same time and not conflict with one another.

modify 
add
commit

big picture workflow
1. create a local branch using the command line (checkout)
2. make your changes to the branch
3. push your stuff up to a new branch on github
4. combine the branch with the master on github
5. pull the master down to your master on your local machine.
