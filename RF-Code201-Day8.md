Code 201 - Day 8 Journal

Day 8 - Wednesday 11/16 2016

Heres what we did
1. Code review
- I was able to follow along with the code revew much better today than yesterday
- We covered how to add a default value to a constructor |
- Having each student go through the code line by line was a good thing for us to do
2. New Material: Forms + Events
- Forms: How to get data from the screen into the program. Finally. I am tired of alerts.
-- My CodePen - http://codepen.io/RichardFarr/pen/wozbMK?editors=1111
- Events in JS
--
3. We reviewed the lab for today which had 2 parts.
Part 1 - Get data in though the input form (see codepen above) & update the table (I did this)
Part 2 - Update the logic so if the location already exists, just update the current data. (did not do)

What I found most useful
- Taking turns reading and explaining each line of code in class during the code review

Questions/Comments
- None I can think of right now.
