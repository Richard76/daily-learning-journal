F Code 201 - Day 7 Journal

Day 7 - Tuesday 11/15 2016

Heres what we did
1. Code review
- I honestly thought I understood yesterdays assignment until I we did the code review today. I just got confused and frustrated. For the first time, I didn't get much positive out of the code review today.
- My one takeaway was thinking when looking at other peoples object code I need to think 1. what are this objects characteristics and 2. what can I do with this object (methods)
- I also realized that I need to better job naming pretty much everything in my code.
2. Constructors
- we reviewed that they are basically templates to create objects
- but, in constructors its functions/metods are kept separate and have slightly different syntax
3. We reviewed the lab for today. Constructors and HTML Tables


What I found most useful
- Having TA's around to help me progress at a snails pace on the labs in the afternoon.

Questions/Comments
- Feeling overwhelmed today... Like I am pushing hard just to barely keep up.
