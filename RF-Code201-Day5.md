RF Code 201 - Day 5 Journal

Day 5 - Friday 11/11 2016

Heres what we did
1. Code review
- We skipped this as yesterdays code was easy!
2. Review of the week -
Mon - lots of terminal & some git
Tue - Project structure - index.html, style.css, and app.js & how to link them together. + Git Branching
Wed - Control Flow + Truthy/Falsy Values. There are 6 falsy values & everything else is truthy. + Arrays.
Thus - CSS display - block vs inline. static, relative, absolute, fixed.
3. Functions (part2)
- how to write a function that accepts an argument or 2+


What I found most useful
- The review was very useful for me.
- I like the function stuff though

Questions
1. I feel like there should be more supporting documention. ie handouts that show how to do the stuff we cover in class with screenshots (or even as pdfs on github or videos better). Will PDFs start getting posted at least?
Specific example - homework to put site live via github pages says as we covered in class. That was not covered in class (between 9 and 12) and there is no documentation that shows how to do it step by step. There should be supporting documentation.
